Common allergies

grass and tree pollen – an allergy to these is known as hay fever (allergic rhinitis)
dust mites
animal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair)
food – particularly nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow's milk
insect bites and stings
medication – including ibuprofen, aspirin, and certain antibiotics
latex – used to make some gloves and condoms
mould – these can release small particles into the air that you can breathe in
household chemicals – including those in detergents and hair dyes



Symptoms of an allergic reaction
Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen.

They can cause:

sneezing
a runny or blocked nose
red, itchy, watery eyes
wheezing and coughing
a red, itchy rash
worsening of asthma or eczema symptoms




antihistamines – these can be taken when you notice the symptoms of a reaction, or before being exposed to an allergen to stop a reaction occurring
decongestants – tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids that can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose
lotions and creams, such as moisturising creams (emollients) – these can reduce skin redness and itchiness
steroid medication – sprays, drops, creams, inhalers and tablets that can help reduce redness and swelling caused by an allergic reaction
